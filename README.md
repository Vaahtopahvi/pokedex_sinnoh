# Sinnoh style Pokédex

This is my personal project, where I first wanted to try and fool around with fetching data from API, but then I thought to myself... _"Hmm, I like Pokemon games, and it would be cool to create something with the help of [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)"._ And then, I got an idea to recreate Sinnoh looking Pokédex from Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl for Nintendo Switch.<br />
I used PokeAPI to fetch and display data like:

- Pokemon Sprite
- Pokemon ID
- Pokemon Name
- Pokemon Height
- Pokemon Weight

and a Pokemon cry, but I couldn't make it playable audio on a website. Though I think own database would make it possible and less of an hassle...

## Actual Pokedéx

Here are few screenshots of the actual Pokédex in-game.

## My version of the Pokédex

For fair comparison, let's compare the same two Pokemons

Yes, I know the actual pokemon looks small. But it's a sprite _(a two-dimensional bitmap)_ and we can't expect much from sprites. If I wanted to make them bigger, the sprite would become quite blurry. <br />
But to be fair, they do look quite cute when they're so small.

## What I used in this project and why?

I only used few, very basic tools to create this project:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Mainly, I wanted to see how well I know css, and all its logic, as well as how well I understand nested divs in html.<br />
And I can proudly say, that I did all styling, style debugging and html by myself.<br /><br />

After styling I got to work with **JS**, and I can tell that, I still need more practice with it. The theory is easier than actually coding it.<br />
Tinkering with JS and DOM was educating and bit challenging, but I learned so much about it. And even though my ".js" file may look little messy and many things could be shortened, it still works the way I wanted it to, so I take it as a win.

## What now?

There are some things I would like to change/improve in this project:

- Play cry of the pokemon once, after pressing 'Play' button
- Make the pokemon shake a little vertically after 'Play' button is pressed
- Add ✨ icon to show shiny variant of the pokemon after pressed
- Dynamic list when searching for a pokemon
- Make image of Pokemon bigger
